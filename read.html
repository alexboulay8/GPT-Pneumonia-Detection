      <i>DISCLAIMER: This project features code and datasets that we do not own or did not write/create. Most of the code was written by ChatGPT of OpenAI as well as MedMNIST Documentation Guide. Please visit their site in the links page to view the code. The PDF of the ChatGPT thread is also available to download in the downloads page.

      For Senior Encounter, a two week internship/shadowing experience with a professional in a chosen 
      field, Us: Alex Boulay and Kaikai Du were tasked with utilizing skills of prompt engineering to 
      have ChatGPT an OpenAI chat bot, write code that would allow us to input Chest X-Ray images and 
      output a prediction on whether the patient has or does not have pneumonia. 
      <br>
      <br>
      To accomplish this we dived into the introduction of prompt engineering, 
      a style of engineering that utilizes A.I chatbots and sends specific prompts 
      to accomplish a task. We used this by splitting our goal into smaller steps that 
      we could then use to send specific prompts to ChatGPT and would allow for the code 
      we received to be accurate. We determined that ChatGPT is incredibly effective at writing code when 
      prompt engineering is applied to most efficiently use the chatbot.

      <h2>Technical Details:</h2>
      While most of the code that we used to accomplish this was written by ChatGPT there were still 
      technical requirements that we needed to do before it would work on our own devices. We needed a 
      fresh install of the newest version of Python 3, 3.11, as well as an install of PyTorch an open 
      source framework for deep learning and neural networks that uses python's engine. Documentation for 
      the install of PyTorch can be found on their website 
      <a href = "https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch Documentation</a>, The installation 
      only requires a pip3 install or through other means listed. 
      <br>
      <br>
      A second challenge that we faced was the importing of the dataset that we used to train our model. 
      We gathered our dataset from the MedMNIST Dataset, this dataset is open source and features both 2D 
      and 3D datasets. We chose Pneumonia as our main dataset because of its straightforward nature as well
      as its Binary Classification which would greatly simplify how we trained our model. While MedMNIST 
      structures their datasets into a NumPy array format with the .npz file format, it comes with 
      documentation that shows examples on how to use built-in PyTorch integration to use the MedMNIST
      dataset for neural networking. The MedMNIST dataset can be found on their website, 
      <a href = "https://medmnist.com/">MedMNIST</a>. As well as their github which provides a guide for 
      implementing MedMNIST dataset into PyTorch, <a href="https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST">MedMNIST 
      Github</a>.

      <h2>Other Information:</h2>
      Access to all files used in this project are listed on this repository. 
      A page with download links for all major files, as well as links to any 
      websites that we used during this project will also be listed. A PDF of the ChatGPT thread used for this project will 
      be available for download as well.

      <h4>Statistics:</h4>
      Below are the values for the area under the curve of the ROC curve for both the training and testing sets which represents the degree or measure of separability and tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. The Accuracy of both our training and testing sets which is calculated by measuring the number of correct predictions made by a model in relation to the total number of predictions made.
      <br><br>
      train  auc: 0.998  acc: 0.985 <br>
      test  auc: 0.960  acc: 0.851
      <br><br>We measured our AUC and ACC for the training set to be 99.7% and 97.7% respectively.
      <br><br>
      We measured our AUC and ACC for the testing set to be 96.6% and 87.3% respectively.
      <br><br>
      Below are the visual representations in the form of graphs of both the loss over each epoch of the model as well as the accuracy throughout each epoch. <br><br>
