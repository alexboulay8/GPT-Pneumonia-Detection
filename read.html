      <h2>Project Introduction:</h2>

      <i>DISCLAIMER: This project features code and datasets that we do not own or did not write/create. Most of the code was written by ChatGPT of OpenAI as well as MedMNIST Documentation Guide. Please visit their site in the links page to view the code. The PDF of the ChatGPT thread is also available to download in the downloads page.

      For Senior Encounter, a two week internship/shadowing experience with a professional in a chosen 
      field, Me, Alex Boulay, and Kaikai Du were tasked with utilizing skills of prompt engineering to 
      have ChatGPT an OpenAI chat bot, write code that would allow us to input Chest X-Ray images and it 
      would output a prediction on whether the patient has or does not have pneumonia. 
      <br>
      <br>
      To accomplish this we dived into the introduction of prompt engineering, 
      a style of engineering that utilizes A.I chatbots and sends specific prompts 
      to accomplish a task. We used this by splitting our goal into smaller steps that 
      we could then use to send specific prompts to ChatGPT and would allow for the code 
      we received to be accurate. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Technical Details:</h2>
      While most of the code that we used to accomplish this was written by ChatGPT there were still 
      technical requirements that we needed to do before it would work on our own devices. We needed a 
      fresh install of the newest version of Python 3, 3.11, as well as an install of PyTorch an open 
      source framework for deep learning and neural networks that uses python's engine. Documentation for 
      the install of PyTorch can be found on their website 
      <a href = "https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">Pytorch Documentation</a>, The installation 
      only requires a pip3 install or through other means listed. 
      <br>
      <br>
      A second challenge that we faced was the importing of the dataset that we used to train our model. 
      We gathered our dataset from the MedMNIST Dataset, this dataset is open source and features both 2D 
      and 3D datasets. We chose Pneumonia as our main dataset because of its straightforward nature as well
      as its Binary Classification which would greatly simplify how we trained our model. While MedMNIST 
      structures their datasets into a NumPy array format with the .npz file format, it comes with 
      documentation that shows examples on how to use built-in PyTorch integration to use the MedMNIST
      dataset for neural networking. The MedMNIST dataset can be found on their website, 
      <a href = "https://medmnist.com/">MedMNIST</a>. As well as their github which provides a guide for 
      implementing MedMNIST dataset into PyTorch, <a href="https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST">MedMNIST 
      Github</a>.

      <h2>Other Information:</h2>
      Access to all files used in this project are listed on this repository. 
      A page with download links for all major files, as well as links to any 
      websites that we used during this project will also be listed. I will also 
      provide a download for the PDF of the ChatGPT thread that was used for this
      project.

      <h4>Statistics:</h4>
      We determined the accuracy of 222 Non-Pneumonia Images when ran through the predictor to be 97.7% accurate.
      <br>
      We also determined that the accuracy of 385 Pneumonia Images to be 90.9% accurate.
      <br>
      We would also like to thank Brad Holloman (Microsoft) and Craig Johns (Johns Hopkins University) for their help.
