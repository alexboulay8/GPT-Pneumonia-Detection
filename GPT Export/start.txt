Recreating Pneumonia Detection.
User
I am an Imaging Data Scientist, I wrote a python script that uses the CNN model for neural networks to create a model for detecting Pneumonia from a patient's chest x-ray images. I would like for you to look at this python script that I wrote and give me specific steps for how someone who is new to this topic could recreate it. 

Here is my code: 

from tqdm import tqdm
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.utils.data as data
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision import transforms


import medmnist
from medmnist import INFO, Evaluator
from PIL import Image

data_flag = 'dataset file type'
# data_flag = 'npz file name eg. pneumoniamnist'
download = True

NUM_EPOCHS = 3 #adjust how many cycles through training set model completes
BATCH_SIZE = 32 #adjust how many training images in each batch model trains with at a time
lr = 0.001

info = INFO[data_flag]
task = info['task']
n_channels = info['n_channels']
num_classes = len(info['label'])


DataClass = getattr(medmnist, info['python_class'])

# preprocessing
data_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[.5], std=[.5])
])

# load the data
train_dataset = DataClass(split='train', transform=data_transform, download=download)
test_dataset = DataClass(split='test', transform=data_transform, download=download)

pil_dataset = DataClass(split='train', download=download)

# encapsulate data into dataloader form
train_loader = data.DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True)
train_loader_at_eval = data.DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, batch_size=2*BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=False)
test_loader = data.DataLoader(dataset=test_dataset, batch_size=2*BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=False)

train_dataset.montage(length=1)

Sure, I'll break down the code into step-by-step instructions for a beginner to recreate it.

1. **Import Required Libraries**: 
    The first part of the code imports necessary libraries and modules for this project. If you don't have them installed, you can do it using pip.
    
    ```python
    from tqdm import tqdm
    import numpy as np
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.optim as optim
    import torch.utils.data as data
    import torchvision.transforms as transforms
    from torchvision import transforms
    import medmnist
    from medmnist import INFO, Evaluator
    from PIL import Image
    ```
    
2. **Configuration and Dataset Preparation**:
    Set up constants and dataset for training, testing, and evaluation. The dataset is from the MedMNIST collection, specifically the one that contains X-ray images of pneumonia. The data is also transformed to ensure they are in the correct format for the model. 

    ```python
    NUM_EPOCHS = 3 
    BATCH_SIZE = 32 
    lr = 0.001
    data_flag = 'dataset file type'
    download = True
    ...
    data_transform = transforms.Compose([...])
    train_dataset = DataClass(split='train', transform=data_transform, download=download)
    test_dataset = DataClass(split='test', transform=data_transform, download=download)
    ...
    train_loader = data.DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True)
    test_loader = data.DataLoader(dataset=test_dataset, batch_size=2*BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=False)
    ```
    
3. **Create the Neural Network**:
    Define the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that will be used to train the model. The CNN consists of several layers including convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. 

    ```python
    class Net(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, in_channels, num_classes):
            ...
        def forward(self, x):
            ...
    model = Net(in_channels=n_channels, num_classes=num_classes)
    ```
   
4. **Set Up the Training Process**:
    Here you specify the loss function and optimizer. Then train the model using the training dataset.

    ```python
    if task == "multi-label, binary-class":
        criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
    else:
        criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr, momentum=0.9)
    for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
        ...
    ```
   
5. **Evaluate the Model**:
    Evaluate the performance of the model using both training and testing dataset.

    ```python
    def test(split):
        ...
    print('==> Evaluating ...')
    test('train')
    test('test')
    ```
   
6. **Save the Model**:
    After training, save the model for future use.

    ```python
    torch.save(model, r'Directory Path to model file with file type .pth')
    ```
   
7. **Load the Model**:
    If you need to use the model in the future, load it with this code.

    ```python
    model = torch.load(r'Directory Path to model file with file type .pth')
    model.eval()
    ```
   
8. **Create a Prediction Function**:
    This function will take an image, preprocess it to match the format of the training images, and then make a prediction on the image using the trained model.

    ```python
    def predict_image(model, image_path):
        ...
    test_image_path = (r"Directory to test image with file type jpeg. jpg
ChatGPT
. png.")
    prediction = predict_image(model, test_image_path)
    print(f'Prediction: {"Pneumonia" if prediction == 1 else "Non-Pneumonia"}')
    ```
   
Remember, you need to replace placeholders like `r"Directory Path to model file with file type .pth"` and `r"Directory to test image with file type jpeg. jpg. png."` with your actual file paths. The `data_flag` needs to be set to the name of the specific MedMNIST dataset you're using. You should have some understanding of PyTorch and Python to successfully recreate this script. If you are new to this, I suggest looking into Python tutorials and PyTorch's official tutorials and documentation.

Could you also look through this code on the prediction function of the network, taking the .pth model and using it to make a prediction based off of a directory stored on the user's computer. Could you explain each part of the code for someone who has no experience with neural networks.

Here is the code:

            nn.ReLU(),

    ])

    return predicted.item()


# Load the saved model/load directory path to where the .pth file is located on your computer
model = torch.load(r'Directory of Model File (.pth)')
model.eval()

# Process each image file in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(test_images_dir):
    if filename.endswith(".jpeg") or filename.endswith(".jpg"):
        image_path = os.path.join(test_images_dir, filename)
        prediction = predict_image(model, image_path)
        print(f"Image: {filename} - Prediction: {'Pneumonia' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Pneumonia'}")

Sure, let's break down each part of this code.

1. **Import Necessary Libraries and Modules**: Import the necessary Python libraries for this task - Torch for the neural network, torchvision for image transformations, PIL for handling image data, and os for file management.

2. **Define the Neural Network (Net)**: This is a class that inherits from `torch.nn.Module`. It's structured like a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 4 Convolutional Layers (Layer 1, 2, 3, 4), each followed by a Batch Normalization and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation function. After the Convolutional Layers, there's a Fully Connected (FC) layer. The `forward` method defines how data flows through this network.

3. **Define a Prediction Function (predict_image)**: This function takes a trained model and an image path, and returns a prediction for that image. The image is opened, converted to grayscale ('L'), transformed (resized and normalized), and then fed into the model. `torch.no_grad()` is used because we're not training the model, so we don't need to calculate gradients.

4. **Load the Trained Model**: Here, a trained model is loaded from a `.pth` file using `torch.load()`.

5. **Prediction on Test Images**: The last part of the code gets a directory with test images and processes each image file in that directory. For each image file, it uses the `predict_image` function to predict whether the image indicates pneumonia. It then prints the prediction.

Remember to replace the placeholders `r'Directory of Model File (.pth)'` and `r"Directory of Test Images / Different to Images used for Training"` with the actual file paths in your environment.

This code requires some understanding of Python, PyTorch and image processing to recreate successfully. If you are new to this, you should consider looking into Python tutorials, PyTorch's official tutorials, and some image processing tutorials.

Could you please give a step by step explanation of this code that takes in an input of test images and uses a already created model to give a prediction of either Pneumonia or non pneumonia?

Certainly, let's go through this step by step:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: First, we import the required libraries. These are Torch for the neural network and tensor computations, Torchvision for transformations on image data, PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image operations, and os for interacting with the operating system, especially file handling.

2. **Define the Neural Network Class**: The `Net` class is a blueprint for a neural network model. It inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. In the `__init__` method, the layers of the neural network are defined. This network consists of five sequential convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. The `forward` method describes how an input `x` goes through the network, which layers it passes through and in what order.

3. **Define a Prediction Function**: `predict_image` is a function that takes a trained model and a path to an image as input. It opens the image, transforms it to a tensor suitable for input into the model, then passes it through the model to get an output. The function then determines which class has the highest output (indicating it's the most probable class), and returns this class as the prediction.

4. **Load the Trained Model**: Here we load the pre-trained model saved as a `.pth` file, using `torch.load()`. This model will be used to make predictions. Note that the placeholder path needs to be replaced with the actual path of the saved model file.

5. **Prediction on Test Images**: We first specify a directory containing the test images. Then, for each image file in the directory, we use the `predict_image` function to make a prediction. The function checks if the image is either a `.jpeg` or a `.jpg` file. If it is, it uses the loaded model to predict if the image indicates Pneumonia or not. Finally, the filename and the prediction are printed to the console. Again, the placeholder path needs to be replaced with the actual directory containing the test images.

It's important to note that this code assumes the model was trained to output two classes: 0 for 'Non-Pneumonia' and 1 for 'Pneumonia'. This mapping is used when printing the prediction results.
