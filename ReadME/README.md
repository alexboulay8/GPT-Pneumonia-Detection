# GPT-Pneumonia-Detection

We are attempting to create a neural network using the pyTorch open source framework that would intake images of Chest X-Rays classified between either Pneumonia or non-Pneumonia and would allow the neural network to predict whether the patient has pneumonia. 

To create a neural network using PyTorch to classify chest x-ray images and determine whether a patient has pneumonia or not, you can follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Prepare your dataset by organizing the chest x-ray images into separate folders for training, validation, and testing. Ensure that each image is labeled accordingly (e.g., pneumonia or not pneumonia).

2. **Data Loading**: Use the `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` class to load the dataset into PyTorch. Apply appropriate transformations, such as resizing and normalization, using `torchvision.transforms.Compose`.

3. **Model Architecture**: Define your neural network model. You can use pre-trained models from `torchvision.models` as a base or create your own custom model using `torch.nn.Module`. Common architectures for image classification include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

4. **Model Training**: Set up your training loop, which includes defining loss function, optimizer, and hyperparameters. Iterate over the training dataset, pass the inputs through the model, calculate the loss, and update the model parameters using backpropagation.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your trained model on the validation dataset to assess its performance. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's effectiveness.

6. **Model Testing**: Finally, evaluate your trained model on the testing dataset to assess its performance on unseen data. Calculate and analyze the metrics to understand the model's real-world effectiveness.

Here's a high-level code template to give you an idea of the implementation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision.datasets as datasets
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torchvision.models as models

# 1. Dataset Preparation
# ...

# 2. Data Loading
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])  # Normalize the image data
])

train_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(train_dir, transform=transform)
val_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(val_dir, transform=transform)
test_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(test_dir, transform=transform)

train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)

# 3. Model Architecture
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
num_classes = 2  # Pneumonia or not pneumonia

# Modify the last layer of the pre-trained model to match the number of classes
in_features = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(in_features, num_classes)

# 4. Model Training
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# 5. Model Evaluation
# ...

# 6. Model Testing
# ...
```

Note that this is a high-level code template, and you may need to modify and customize it to fit your specific dataset, model architecture, and training requirements.

Make sure to set appropriate hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and model architecture based on your dataset and computational resources.

Remember to evaluate and test your model on unseen data
