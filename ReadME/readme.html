        For our Senior Encounter 2023 we shadowed at the Technology Innovation Center at Johns Hopkins. We were tasked with the project of using ChatGPT to compile code that would create a neural network and learn to identify Pneumonia from patient chest x-rays.
        <br>
        <br>
        To accomplish this we used the ChatGPT version 4.0 as well as PyTorch open source framework to create our neural network and MedMNIST online medical dataset. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We started by asking ChatGPT to formulate a checklist that would allow us to accomplish our goal of creating a neural network. We then took principles of prompt engineering to break down our checklist and use ChatGPT to compile code based on very specific inputs. This allowed us to create a framework of what we needed to accomplish and to allow us to specifically ask GPT to compile code based on our needs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To start compiling our python scripts, we needed to install PyTorch and its dependencies, using pip we installed PyTorch and used the documentation to ask GPT to create a program that would allow us to utilize the MedMNIST dataset. While we attempted to use GPT solely to create the programs we needed for machine learning. However due to our lack of knowledge of PyTorch specifics that would allow us to make changes specific to our needs we were unable to create the neural network solely using ChatGPT. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After investigating the documentation of the MedMNIST xray datasets we discovered on the creators github, documentation for implementing the datasets using PyTorch into a machine learning training script. We followed the guide and used it to pull the dataset from the repository and format it so that the training module would work as intended.

        TBD
